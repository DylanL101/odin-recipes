                        Cook the potatoes for around 15 minutes, they will be tender but still firm.

                    <li>Combine the mashed potato, 1 cup of flour and the egg in a large mixing bowl.
                         Knead the dough until it is a ball.
                        Shape the ball proportionately into long strips.
                        Flour your work surface, cut the strips into half-inch sized pieces. </li>
